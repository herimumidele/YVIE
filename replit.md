## Project Architecture

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- Vite build system with hot reload
- Tailwind CSS with custom brand colors
- shadcn/ui component library
- TanStack Query for data fetching
- Wouter for routing

### Backend (Node.js + Express)
- PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM
- Replit Auth for authentication
- RESTful API endpoints
- Session management with express-session

### Database Schema
- Users, Apps, Templates, Posts, Notifications, UserStats tables
- Proper relations and foreign keys
- Sample data for development

## Next Development Priorities
1. **App Builder Core Functionality**
   - Drag-and-drop canvas component
   - AI component library (chatbot, image gen, text analysis)
   - Visual workflow builder
   - Component configuration panels
   - Real-time preview system

2. **Backend API Development**
   - Complete CRUD operations for apps
   - App deployment and hosting logic
   - Template management system
   - Community features (posts, comments, ratings)
   - Notification system

3. **AI Integration**
   - Component execution engine
   - AI model integrations (OpenAI, etc.)
   - Workflow processing pipeline
   - Error handling and logging

## Technical Decisions
- Using Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- Implementing server-side validation with Zod schemas
- Storing app configurations as JSON in database
- Building modular component system for extensibility
